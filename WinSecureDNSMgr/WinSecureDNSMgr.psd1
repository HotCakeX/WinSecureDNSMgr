ðŸ’Ž This is a PowerShell module that can simplify setting up DNS over HTTPS in Windows for various scenarios ðŸ’Ž


ðŸ”· DNS over HTTPS in Windows using the default built-in OS DoH providers
ðŸ”· DNS over HTTPS in Windows using a custom DoH provider that has static IP address(s)
ðŸ”· DNS over HTTPS in Windows using a custom DoH provider that has dynamic IP address(s)


It can automatically identify the correct and active network adapter/interface and set Secure DNS settings for it based on parameters supplied by user.


âœ… Features

âœ… Strongest possible End-to-End encrypted workflow

âœ… Created, targeted and tested on the latest version of Windows, on physical hardware and Virtual Machines

âœ… To make sure the module will always be able to acquire the IP address(s) of the DoH server, specially in case of dynamic DoH server when the currently set system IPv4s and IPv6s might be outdated, the module performs DNS queries in this exact order:

âœ…  - First tries using Cloudflare's main encrypted API to get the IP address(s) of the DoH server's domain.
âœ…  - If 1st one fails, tries using the Cloudflare's secondary encrypted API to get the IP address(s) of the DoH server's domain.
âœ…  - If 2nd one fails, tries using Google's main encrypted API to get the IP address(s) of the DoH server's domain.
âœ…  - If 3rd one fails, tries using Google's secondary encrypted API to get the IP address(s) of the DoH server's domain.

âœ… All of the connections to Cloudflare and Google servers use direct IP, are set to use TLS 1.3 with TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 cipher suite and use HTTP/2
